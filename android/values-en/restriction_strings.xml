    <string name="restriction_description_appID">"The app ID used to identify the application to the data vault. If you are using SAP Mobile Platform, this should be consistent with the app ID of the target application. Note that this value is distinct from the package name, which is mainly used to identify your application in app stores."</string>

    <string name="restriction_title_fioriURL">"Fiori Server URL"</string>
    <string name="restriction_description_fioriURL">"The full URL of the target application. If your application does not use SAP Mobile Platform, it navigates directly to this URL once logon is completed. If your app does use SAP Mobile Platform, this URL is parsed and used in the following way: 1. The URL scheme (which must be HTTP or HTTPS) determines the initial value of the \'https\' flag in the registration dialog. Similarly, the host and port in the URL determine their corresponding initial values in the registration dialog, with port defaulting to 443 if it is not specified. 2. The URL suffix (everything after the host and port) is appended to the URL that the user registers to. Though this is likely to be the same as the scheme, host, and port from 1., the user can change these values. However, the suffix cannot be changed. If you are using SAP Mobile Platform, specify the scheme, host, and port of your SAP Mobile Platform server, followed by the suffix of the Fiori endpoint. For example: \'https://my.smp.server:8081/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/ui2/ushell/shells/abap/FioriLaunchpad.html\'"</string>
