    <string name="restriction_title_appID">Application ID</string>
    <string name="restriction_description_appID">The appID used to identify the application to the data vault. If you are
            using SMP, this should be consistent with the appID of the target application. Note that
            this value is distinct from the packageName, which is mainly used to identify your
            application in app stores.</string>

    <string name="restriction_title_fioriURL">Fiori Server URL</string>
    <string name="restriction_description_fioriURL">The full URL of the target application. If your application does not
            use SMP, it will navigate directly to this URL once logon is completed. If your app
            does use SMP, this URL is parsed and used in the following way:
               1. The URL scheme (which must be http or https) determines the inital value
                  of the \'https\' flag in the registration dialog. Similarly, the host and port
                  in the URL determine their corresponding initial values in the registration dialog,
                  with port defaulting to 443 if it\'s not specified.
               2. The URL suffix (everything after the host and port) is appended to the URL that
                  the user registers to. Though this is likely to be the same as the scheme, host and
                  port from 1., the user has the opportunity to change these values. In contrast,
                  the suffix can\'t be changed.
             If you are using SMP, you will ultimately want to specify the scheme, host and port of
             your SMP server, followed by the suffix of the Fiori endpoint. For example:

             \'https://my.smp.server:8081/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/ui2/ushell/shells/abap/FioriLaunchpad.html\'</string>
